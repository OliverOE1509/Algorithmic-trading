# Algorithmic-trading
A repository for my attempt at coding a working algorithmic trading setup

The two files of interest are My_portfolio2.py and check_portfolio.py, dont mind the copy.

My_portfolio2.py contains the definition of the parent class that defines all functions universal in all algorithmic trading strategies. This is for instance the buy and sell function. I will later implement a function, that will plot the equity curve of the total value of the portfolio.

check_portfolio.py is the first strategy I have defined, and it inherits the object "Portef√∏lje", which I defined in My_portfolio.
